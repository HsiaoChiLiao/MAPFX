\title{Initial biological clusters}
\usage{
initM(paths, assay, bkb.v, plots = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{a vector of characters of paths to store intput, intermediary results, outputs...}

\item{assay}{the type of the input data - MPC or FFC.}

\item{bkb.v}{a vector of the names of the backbone markers (MUST match to the names in the FCS file).}

\item{plots}{logical; if TRUE (default), produce a UMAP embedding plot to visualise the structure of the biological clusters to form the initial M matrix for removal of well effect.}
}
\value{
Updating the metadata for cells in the fcs_metadata_df.rds file, adding the information of the initial biological clusters. Visualising the result with the scatter plots.
}
\description{
Generating the M matrix for removing well effects.
}
\details{
This function has been designed to find initial biological clusters with centred transformed data.
